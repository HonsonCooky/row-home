# Idea Overview

**_Exploring the Concept of "RowHome" and VimG: A Novel Approach to Game Development._**

In the ever-evolving world of gaming, where innovation and creativity reign supreme, we'd like to introduce you to a
fresh perspective on game development. It's called the "RowHome" game engine, and it represents a shift in how we
approach creating and enjoying games. Let's delve into the concept and philosophy behind "RowHome" and the unique game
genre it's introducing, "VimG" (Visual Improved Gamification).

VimG, pronounced like "scrimmage," draws inspiration from a not-so-surprising source: Vim, the renowned text editor. At
its core, VimG adheres to Vim's principles, including modal states, keyboard-based inputs, and the motions. These
elements form the foundation of VimG games, creating an experience that's both familiar (to Vim / Neovim users) and
unique.

The driving force behind RowHome is to empower individuals by building upon the programming skills and current workflow
they already possess. Many modern game development environments demand a significant investment in learning new
interfaces and workflows, presenting a steep learning curve. RowHome challenges this status quo by enabling developers
to create keyboard-based games efficiently, with their existing tools.

Sure, I can help you with that. Here is one possible way to rewrite the text without repeating ideas:

RowHome is a game development environment that offers the following features:

1. **Workflow Compatibility:** You can use RowHome with your existing IDE, whether it is Vim or Neovim, and develop
   video games without switching tools. RowHome is optimized for Vim and Neovim users, giving you a seamless and smooth
   game development experience.

2. **Text-Based Graphics:** You can create animations and images using text formats with RowHome, instead of relying on
   UI-based tools and mouse interactions. This way, you can stay in your coding environment and create games with
   text-based graphics.

3. **Keyboard-Based Games:** RowHome's tools are specially designed for Vim-like functionalities, allowing you to use
   your Vim skills to play and create immersive games. You can use familiar keyboard-based inputs to explore captivating
   worlds and interactive narratives with VimG games built with RowHome. This creates a new dimension of immersive
   gaming where your keyboard is the portal to endless adventures and creative possibilities.

4. **Minimal Abstractions:** RowHome gives you direct access to the underlying mechanics and code of game development,
   instead of hiding them behind layers of abstraction. This way, you can use your programming knowledge to the fullest
   and have more control and customization over your games. RowHome also enhances your understanding of game development
   and challenges your mathematics and problem solving skills. You can still use community based packages to enable
   common features, but by default, RowHome empowers you to craft unique and innovative gaming experiences.

In essence, RowHome is about bridging the gap between your professional life and your passion for game development. Many
aspiring developers enter the industry with game development dreams, but the complexities of life often intervene,
diverting their paths along unforeseen trajectories, compounded by the daunting realization that there's simply too much
to learn in the modern day to pick it all up easily. RowHome is an invitation to create, explore, and innovate without
the constraints of traditional game development environments. Whether you're a seasoned developer looking for a creative
outlet or a gamer eager to program, VimG and RowHome offer a unique path to achieving your goals.

Welcome to a revitalized era in game development.
